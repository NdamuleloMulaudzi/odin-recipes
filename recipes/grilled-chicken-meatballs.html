    <h2>This technique for grilled chicken meatballs is the only way to go. By pre-baking the meatballs, they finish quickly on the grill, and stay moist and juicy every time. A hoisin-ginger glaze makes a beautiful, glossy meatball, but you can flavor them just about any way you want.</h2>
    <p>There’s a good reason you don’t often see grilled meatballs on a menu, and that’s because they are virtually impossible to do unless you know this simple, bake-ahead trick. If you ever want to get really frustrated, try to get balls of raw, ground meat to stay on a skewer. Even if you somehow accomplish that, then try to grill them without the meatballs falling apart. Spoiler alert: you won’t be able to. That’s a fool’s errand, and since we’re no fools, we’re going to be shaping and baking the balls beforehand, which makes everything so much easier, and virtually stress-free. </p>
    <h2>Ingrients</h2>
    <h3>Meatballs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground chicken</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mirin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/3 cup thinly sliced green onions</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plain fine bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Glaze</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar/li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to make Grilled Chicken Meatballs</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Add chicken, sesame oil, soy sauce, mirin, salt, pepper, cayenne, green onions, garlic, and bread crumbs to a bowl, and use a fork to gently but thoroughly mix everything together. Wrap and chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes before shaping.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2: </strong>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil, and lightly grease the foil.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3: </strong>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Meatballs will be just cooked through, and an instant read thermometer inserted near the center will read 145 to 150 degrees F (63 to 66 degrees C).</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4: </strong>Let cool; wrap and keep in the refrigerator until needed. These can be made the day before.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5: </strong>Preheat an outdoor grill, preferably charcoal, for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate. Stir ketchup, hoisin, fresh ginger, and rice vinegar together in a small bowl, and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6: </strong>Place 4 meatballs on each skewer, and grill until lightly charred and heated through, about 3 minutes per side. Turn over, and brush with glaze. Turn back over, so the brushed side is down, and let sear for about 30 seconds; meanwhile, brush top with glaze.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 7: </strong>Turn over once more and let sear for about 30 seconds; remove from the heat. Apply more glaze after removing from the grill, as desired. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
