    <h2>The German potato salad features tender potatoes in a flavorful bacon vinaigrette. </h2>
    <p>Unlike mayonnaise-based American potato salads, German potato salad is tossed in a vinegar-based dressing made with bacon drippings. It is usually served warm instead of cold, but some people prefer to serve it at room temperature.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Potatoes:</strong> We recommend using waxy potatoes (such as New Potatoes) because they hold their shape well. Yukon Gold, an all-purpose variety, is also a good choice. </li>
        <li><strong>Bacon:</strong> Bacon (and its grease) adds tons of meaty flavor to the hearty German potato salad. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>Onion:</strong> An onion, cooked in bacon grease, lends even more complexity and flavor. </li>
        <li><strong>Vinegar:</strong> White vinegar adds tanginess that cuts through the richness from the potatoes and bacon.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> A bit of white sugar gives the savory potato salad subtle sweetness. </li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings and herbs:</strong> This German potato salad recipe is seasoned with salt, pepper, and fresh parsleys.</li>
    </ul>
